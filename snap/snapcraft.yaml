# Base runtime
# The common runtime for the snap to run on, or `bare` for static linked applications
base: core18

# Security confinement
# Use `devmode` to getting started
# Flip to `strict` once you have the right plugs and slots,
# or `classic` once you determine that strict confinement is not currently possible
confinement: strict

# Snap Grade
# Use `devel` to getting started
# Flip to `stable` once you determine that the snap is matured, only `stable` grade
# snaps can be promoted to `candidate` and `stable` channels
grade: stable

# Run `snapcraft help sources` for supported keywords on pulling a part's source ingredients
# Run `snapcraft plugins` for supported build helper plugins
